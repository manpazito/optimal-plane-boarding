# Optimal Plane Boarding ✈️

Boarding a plane takes *forever*.  
Some airlines start **30–50 minutes** before takeoff, yet we still end up in slow-moving lines and aisle traffic jams.

**The question:** What’s the fastest, fairest way to get everyone on board?

This project uses **simulations, data analysis, and optimization algorithms** to test boarding strategies — from the classic zone method to creative, data-driven solutions — with one goal:  
**minimize boarding time without losing sanity.**

Stay tuned for results.

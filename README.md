# optimal-plane-seating-ordering
This is a fun project I'm working on. Many times while flying, you'll notice that boarding takes a while. Some airlines will begin boarding 30 minutes before takeoff and other times even up to 50 minutes. It takes a while and everyone wants to be first. The question I'm trying to solve is: what is the best way to get everyone on board the plane?
